Hi there! In this project, I focused on honing my time series forecasting skills. 
I developed functions to autonomously calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) scores for each model.
Using the US export dataset, I built an ARIMA model to forecast future export quantities for the next three years. 
While the process was tedious at times, it proved to be incredibly enlightening and rewarding.
